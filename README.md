# StellarAuth

## Summary
StellarAuth is a developer API and user application service for **easily and securely assigning Stellar accounts to your users from within your app.** Kind of like **Authy (2FA) for Stellar**, but also a lot like a combination of **Sign In with Apple and Apple Card**. Essentially it’s a secure way to give your users a Stellar account which you can send requests to and they can accept or decline in an intuitive interface. You won’t store secrets, we don’t have access to secrets and the user won’t have to deal with anything they're not already familiar with.
